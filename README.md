# malware-analysis-rice
So this is my newly created KDE plasma rice that I am running under virtualbox to mainly analyse malware but maybe also develop software.
My main goal with this setup was to create something amazingly beautiful instead of the boring Remnux default installation desktop enviroment

This is basically my setup so far after about a day of working on it

OS:Kubuntu

Window manager:kwin

Plasma Theme:Sweet

Program theme:Breeze

Window decorations:Sweet-Dark

Dock:latte dock

Icons:Breeze dark

Colour scheme:Materia Manjaro

Fonts:Geistmono Nerd font for the most part

Terminal:default KDE terminal nothing special

Wallpaper:the wallpaper was found at wallpapercave https://wallpapercave.com/download/android-hd-virus-bacteria-wallpapers-wp5909189 and I picked it to fit my kind of working enviroment
The custom neofetch was made using https://github.com/Chick2D/neofetch-themes

widgets:aesthetic clock ,NowPlayingRe

and of course the firefox custom background is from furaffinity https://www.furaffinity.net/view/54384238/ because I thought it looked super cute

this is how you can add this image or any other custom image into firefox https://superuser.com/questions/1495946/how-do-i-change-the-background-image-of-home-page-in-firefox

Firefox theme:galaxy cool thing
